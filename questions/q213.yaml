  ```rust
  trait MyTrait {
      fn method(&self) -> Self;
  }

  struct MyStruct;

  impl MyTrait for MyStruct {
      fn method(&self) -> Self {
          MyStruct
      }
  }

  fn main() {
      let s = MyStruct;
      let _trait_obj: &dyn MyTrait = &s;
  }
  ```

  What happens when you try to compile this code?
answers:
- The code compiles and runs successfully
- 'Compilation error: the trait `MyTrait` is not dyn compatible'
- 'Compilation error: `MyStruct` does not implement `MyTrait`'
- Runtime panic occurs when creating the trait object
correct_answer: 1
expected_output:
- the trait `MyTrait` is not dyn compatible
explanation: |-
  This question tests understanding of dyn compatibility (formerly called object
  safety) in Rust, which determines whether a trait can be used as a trait object
  (with `dyn`).

  A trait is dyn compatible only if it meets certain criteria. One key requirement
  is that methods cannot return `Self` by value, because when using a trait
  object, the concrete type is erased at runtime and the compiler doesn't know the
  size of `Self` to allocate the return value properly.

  In this code, the `method` function returns `Self`, which violates dyn
  compatibility rules. When attempting to create a trait object `&dyn MyTrait`,
  the compiler detects this violation and produces a compilation error indicating
  that the trait is not dyn compatible because the method references `Self` in its
  return type.

  The key takeaway is that dyn compatibility restrictions exist because trait
  objects involve dynamic dispatch where the concrete type is not known at compile
  time. Methods that return `Self`, use `Self` in certain positions, or have
  generic type parameters (among other restrictions) prevent a trait from being
  dyn compatible. To make a trait dyn compatible, you would need to either return
  a boxed trait object like `Box<dyn MyTrait>`, use associated types differently,
  or redesign the API to avoid returning `Self`.
