question: |-
  ```rust
  fn main() {
      let opt: Option<i32> = Some(42);
      let res: Result<i32, &str> = opt.ok_or("missing value");
      
      let opt2: Option<i32> = res.ok();
      
      println!("{:?}, {:?}", res, opt2);
  }
  ```

  What does this print?
answers:
- Ok(42), Some(42)
- Err("missing value"), None
- 'Compilation error: cannot convert between `Option` and `Result`'
- Some(42), Ok(42)
correct_answer: 0
expected_output:
- Ok(42), Some(42)
explanation: |-
  This question tests understanding of conversion methods between `Option` and
  `Result` types in Rust.

  The code demonstrates two key conversion methods:

  1. **`ok_or` method**: Converts `Option<T>` to `Result<T, E>`. When called on
  `Some(42)`, it produces `Ok(42)`. If it had been called on `None`, it would have
  produced `Err("missing value")` using the provided error value.

  2. **`ok` method**: Converts `Result<T, E>` to `Option<T>`. When called on
  `Ok(42)`, it produces `Some(42)`. If it had been called on an `Err` variant, it
  would have produced `None`, discarding the error information.

  The execution flow is:
  - `opt` starts as `Some(42)`
  - `opt.ok_or("missing value")` converts it to `Ok(42)` and stores it in `res`
  - `res.ok()` converts `Ok(42)` back to `Some(42)` and stores it in `opt2`
  - The print statement outputs both values: `Ok(42), Some(42)`

  The key takeaway is that Rust provides convenient methods to convert between
  `Option` and `Result` types. The `ok_or` and `ok_or_else` methods convert
  `Option` to `Result` by providing an error value for the `None` case, while the
  `ok` method converts `Result` to `Option` by discarding any error information.
