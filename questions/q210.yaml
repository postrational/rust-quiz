  ```rust
  trait MyTrait {
      fn method(&self) -> Self;
  }

  struct MyStruct;

  impl MyTrait for MyStruct {
      fn method(&self) -> Self {
          MyStruct
      }
  }

  fn main() {
      let s = MyStruct;
      let _trait_obj: &dyn MyTrait = &s;
  }
  ```

  What happens when you try to compile this code?
answers:
- The code compiles and runs successfully
- 'Compilation error: the trait `MyTrait` is not dyn compatible because method `method` references the `Self` type in its return type'
- 'Compilation error: `MyStruct` does not implement `MyTrait`'
- Runtime panic occurs when creating the trait object
correct_answer: 1
expected_output:
- the trait `MyTrait` is not dyn compatible
- because method `method` references the `Self` type in its return type
explanation: |-
  This question tests understanding of dyn compatibility (formerly called object
  safety) in Rust, which determines whether a trait can be used as a trait object
  (e.g., `&dyn Trait` or `Box<dyn Trait>`).

  For a trait to be dyn compatible, it must satisfy several requirements. One
  critical requirement is that methods cannot return `Self` by value. The reason
  is that when using a trait object, the concrete type is erased at runtimeâ€”the
  compiler only knows it's "some type that implements this trait." If a method
  returns `Self`, the compiler wouldn't know the size of the return value at
  compile time, making it impossible to generate correct code.

  In this code, the trait `MyTrait` has a method that returns `Self`, which
  violates dyn compatibility rules. While `MyStruct` correctly implements the
  trait, the attempt to create a trait object `&dyn MyTrait` fails because the
  trait itself is not dyn compatible.

  The key takeaway is that dyn compatibility is a property of the trait, not the
  implementation. Traits with methods that return `Self`, have generic type
  parameters, or use `Self: Sized` bounds (among other restrictions) cannot be
  used as trait objects. This is a compile-time check that ensures type safety and
  prevents runtime errors related to unknown sizes.
