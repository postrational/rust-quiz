  ```rust
  use std::collections::BTreeSet;

  fn main() {
      let mut set = BTreeSet::new();
      set.insert(5);
      set.insert(2);
      set.insert(8);
      set.insert(2);
      set.insert(1);
      
      let range: Vec<_> = set.range(2..=6).collect();

  This question tests understanding of BTreeSet properties and the range method. A
  BTreeSet is an ordered set collection that automatically maintains elements in
  sorted order and does not allow duplicates.

  When elements are inserted into the BTreeSet (5, 2, 8, 2, 1), the duplicate
  insertion of 2 is ignored since sets only store unique values. The resulting set
  contains {1, 2, 5, 8} in sorted order.

  The `range(2..=6)` method returns an iterator over elements within the specified
  range. The range `2..=6` is inclusive on both ends, meaning it includes all
  elements where 2 ≤ element ≤ 6. From the set {1, 2, 5, 8}, only two elements
  fall within this range: 2 and 5. The element 1 is below the range, and 8 is
  above it.

  The iterator is collected into a Vec, which contains references to these 2
  elements, so `range.len()` returns 2.

  The key takeaways are that BTreeSet automatically deduplicates elements and
  maintains sorted order, and the range method allows efficient querying of
  elements within a specified range using the tree structure.
