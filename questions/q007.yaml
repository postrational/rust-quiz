  This question tests understanding of Rust's reference chains and comparison
  semantics. The code creates a chain of references where `x` is an `i32` with
  value `5`, `y` is `&x` (type `&i32`), and `z` is `&y` (type `&&i32`).

  The three comparisons demonstrate different levels of dereferencing:

  1. `x == **z`: This compares the value `5` with `**z`. Dereferencing `z` twice
  (`**z`) gives us `*(&x)`, which equals `5`. So `5 == 5` is `true`.

  2. `&x == *z`: This compares references. Dereferencing `z` once (`*z`) gives us
  `y`, which is `&x`. So we're comparing `&x == &x`, which is `true` because they
  point to the same location.

  3. `&&x == z`: This compares double references. Since `z` is `&y` and `y` is
  `&x`, we have `z` as `&&x`. The expression `&&x` creates a temporary double
  reference to `x`, which points to the same location as `z`. Therefore `&&x == z`
  is `true`.

  The key takeaway is that Rust's `==` operator can compare references at any
  level of indirection, and references are equal when they point to the same
  memory location. The compiler handles the appropriate dereferencing and
  comparison logic automatically.
