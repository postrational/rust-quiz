  ```rust
  trait MyTrait {
      fn method(&self) -> Self;
  }

  struct MyStruct;

  impl MyTrait for MyStruct {
      fn method(&self) -> Self {
          MyStruct
      }
  }

  fn main() {
      let s = MyStruct;
      let _trait_obj: &dyn MyTrait = &s;
  }
  ```

  What happens when you try to compile this code?
answers:
- The code compiles and runs successfully
- 'Compilation error: the trait `MyTrait` is not dyn compatible because method `method` references the `Self` type in its return type'
- 'Compilation error: `MyStruct` does not implement `MyTrait`'
- Runtime panic occurs when creating the trait object
correct_answer: 1
expected_output:
- the trait `MyTrait` is not dyn compatible
- because method `method` references the `Self` type in its return type
explanation: |-
  This question tests understanding of dyn compatibility (formerly called object
  safety) in Rust, which determines whether a trait can be used as a trait object
  (with `dyn`).

  A trait is dyn compatible only if it meets certain criteria. One key requirement
  is that methods cannot return `Self` by value, because when using a trait
  object, the concrete type is erased at runtime and the compiler cannot know the
  size of the return value.

  In this code, the `method` function returns `Self`, which violates dyn
  compatibility rules. When attempting to create a trait object `&dyn MyTrait`,
  the compiler rejects this because `MyTrait` is not dyn compatible.

  The key rules for dyn compatibility include:
  - Methods cannot return `Self` by value (though `&Self` and `&mut Self` are
  allowed)
  - Methods cannot have generic type parameters
  - The trait cannot require `Sized` (trait objects are `!Sized`)

  The takeaway is that not all traits can be used as trait objects. If you need
  dynamic dispatch with a trait that returns `Self`, you'll need to redesign the
  API, perhaps by using associated types, boxing the return value, or using a
  different pattern altogether.
