explanation: |-
  This question tests understanding of associated types, trait bounds, and the
  `Into` trait in Rust.

  The key to this question is recognizing that `i32: Into<i32>` is indeed
  implemented in the standard library as an identity conversion. Every type `T`
  implements `Into<T>`, allowing a value to be converted into itself.

  The `apply_twice` function has a generic constraint `where P::Output:
  Into<P::Input>`, which requires that the output type can be converted into the
  input type. For the `Doubler` implementation, both `Input` and `Output` are
  `i32`, so this constraint is satisfied by the identity implementation of
  `Into<i32>` for `i32`.

  The execution flow is:
  1. `apply_twice(&d, 5)` is called
  2. First call: `processor.process(5)` returns `5 * 2 = 10`
  3. `first.into()` converts `10` to `10` (identity conversion)
  4. Second call: `processor.process(10)` returns `10 * 2 = 20`
  5. The result `20` is printed

  The key takeaway is that Rust's standard library provides identity
  implementations of conversion traits like `Into<T>` for all types `T`, which
  allows for flexible generic code that can work with both same-type and
  different-type conversions.
