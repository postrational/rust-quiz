question: |-
  ```rust
  trait MyTrait {
      fn method(&self) -> Self;
  }

  struct MyStruct;

  impl MyTrait for MyStruct {
      fn method(&self) -> Self {
          MyStruct
      }
  }

  fn main() {
      let s = MyStruct;
      let _trait_obj: &dyn MyTrait = &s;
  }
  ```

  What happens when you try to compile this code?
answers:
- The code compiles and runs successfully
- 'Compilation error: the trait `MyTrait` is not dyn compatible'
- 'Compilation error: `MyStruct` does not implement `MyTrait`'
- Runtime panic occurs when creating the trait object
correct_answer: 1
expected_output:
- the trait `MyTrait` is not dyn compatible
- because method `method` references the `Self` type in its return type
explanation: |-
  This question tests understanding of dyn compatibility (formerly called object
  safety) in Rust, which determines whether a trait can be used as a trait object
  (with `dyn`).

  A trait is dyn compatible only if it meets certain criteria. One key requirement
  is that methods cannot return `Self` (except in specific cases like
  `Box<Self>`). When a method returns `Self`, the compiler cannot determine the
  concrete size of the return type at compile time when working with a trait
  object, since trait objects are dynamically sized.

  In this code, the `method` function in `MyTrait` returns `Self`, which violates
  dyn compatibility rules. When attempting to create a trait object `&dyn
  MyTrait`, the compiler detects this violation and produces a compilation error
  indicating that the trait is not dyn compatible because the method references
  `Self` in its return type.

  The key takeaway is that not all traits can be used as trait objects. Dyn
  compatibility rules exist to ensure that trait objects can be used safely with
  dynamic dispatch. Methods that return `Self`, use generic type parameters, or
  have `where Self: Sized` bounds (among other restrictions) prevent a trait from
  being dyn compatible.
