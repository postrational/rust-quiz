  ```rust
  trait MyTrait {
      fn method(&self) -> Self;
  }

  struct MyStruct;

  impl MyTrait for MyStruct {
      fn method(&self) -> Self {
          MyStruct
      }
  }

  fn main() {
      let s = MyStruct;
      let _trait_obj: &dyn MyTrait = &s;
      println!("Success");
  }
  ```

  What happens when you try to compile this code?
answers:
- The code compiles and prints `Success`
- 'Compilation error: the trait `MyTrait` is not dyn compatible because method `method` references the `Self` type in its return type'
- 'Compilation error: trait objects must be behind a pointer'
- Runtime panic occurs when creating the trait object
correct_answer: 1
expected_output:
- the trait `MyTrait` is not dyn compatible
- method `method` references the `Self` type in its return type
explanation: |-
  This question tests understanding of dyn compatibility (formerly called object
  safety) in Rust, which determines whether a trait can be used as a trait object
  (e.g., `dyn MyTrait`).

  A trait is dyn compatible only if it meets certain criteria. One key requirement
  is that methods cannot return `Self` by value. The reason is that when using a
  trait object, the concrete type is erased at runtimeâ€”the compiler only knows
  it's "some type that implements MyTrait," not the specific size or type.
  Returning `Self` would require knowing the concrete type's size at compile time,
  which is impossible with trait objects.

  In this code, the `method` function returns `Self`, which violates dyn
  compatibility rules. When the code attempts to create a trait object `&dyn
  MyTrait`, the compiler rejects it with an error explaining that the trait is not
  dyn compatible because the method references `Self` in its return type.

  The key takeaway is that dyn compatibility is a compile-time property that
  restricts which traits can be used as trait objects. Methods that return `Self`,
  use `Self` in certain positions, or have generic type parameters generally make
  a trait not dyn compatible. Understanding these rules is crucial when designing
  traits that need to support dynamic dispatch.
