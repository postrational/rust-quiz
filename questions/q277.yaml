  ```rust
  fn main() {
      let x = &42;
      let y = &x;
      let z = **y;
      println!("{}", z);
  }
  ```

  What does this code output?
answers:
- '42'
- 'Compilation error: cannot dereference `&i32` twice'
- 'Runtime panic: invalid double dereference'
- 'Compilation error: type mismatch in assignment'

expected_output:
- '42'
explanation: |-
  This question tests understanding of multiple levels of references and the
  dereference operator in Rust. The code demonstrates that Rust allows
  dereferencing through multiple layers of references.

  In this code, `x` has type `&i32` (a reference to an `i32` value 42). Then `y`
  is assigned `&x`, making it type `&&i32` (a reference to a reference to an
  `i32`).

  When we write `**y`, we perform two dereference operations: the first `*y`
  dereferences `y` to get `x` (which is `&42`), and the second dereference
  `*(&42)` gives us the actual value 42. Since `i32` implements the `Copy` trait,
  this value is copied into `z`.

  The key takeaway is that Rust supports arbitrary levels of reference nesting,
  and you can dereference through multiple layers using multiple `*` operators.
  Each `*` removes one level of indirection. This is a fundamental aspect of
  Rust's type system and pointer semantics.
