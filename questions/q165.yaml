  ```rust
  use std::ffi::OsString;

  fn main() {
      let mut os_string = OsString::from("hello");
      os_string.push("_world");
      
      let string_result = os_string.into_string();

              println!("Original: {:?}", os_str);
          }
      }
  }
  ```

  What happens when this code runs?
answers:
- 'Prints: `Converted: hello_world`'
- "Compilation error: `push` method doesn't exist for `OsString`"
- 'Prints: `Failed to convert` and shows the original `OsString`'
- 'Runtime panic: invalid UTF-8 sequence in `OsString`'
correct_answer: 0
expected_output:
- 'Converted: hello_world'

  This question tests understanding of `OsString` and its relationship with UTF-8
  validation in Rust.

  `OsString` is a platform-native string type that can hold any byte sequence
  valid for the operating system, which may or may not be valid UTF-8. In this
  code, an `OsString` is created from the string literal "hello" (valid UTF-8),
  and then "_world" (also valid UTF-8) is appended using the `push` method.

  The `into_string()` method attempts to convert the `OsString` into a regular
  `String`. This method returns a `Result<String, OsString>` because the
  conversion can fail if the `OsString` contains invalid UTF-8 sequences. Since
  `String` in Rust must always contain valid UTF-8, the conversion will only
  succeed if all bytes in the `OsString` form valid UTF-8.

  In this case, both "hello" and "_world" are valid UTF-8 strings, so the entire
  content of the `OsString` is valid UTF-8. Therefore, `into_string()` succeeds
  and returns `Ok("hello_world")`, which matches the first branch of the match
  statement and prints "Converted: hello_world".

  The key takeaway is that `OsString` provides a safe abstraction for
  platform-specific strings while `into_string()` provides a safe way to convert
  to UTF-8-validated `String` when needed. The `Result` return type ensures that
  invalid UTF-8 sequences are handled explicitly rather than causing undefined
  behavior or panics.
