  ```rust
  trait MyTrait {
      fn method(&self) -> Self;
  }

  struct MyStruct;

  impl MyTrait for MyStruct {
      fn method(&self) -> Self {
          MyStruct
      }
  }

  fn main() {
      let s = MyStruct;
      let _trait_obj: &dyn MyTrait = &s;
  }
  ```

  What happens when you try to compile this code?
answers:
- The code compiles and runs successfully
- 'Compilation error: the trait `MyTrait` is not dyn compatible'
- 'Compilation error: `MyStruct` does not implement `MyTrait`'
- Runtime panic occurs when creating the trait object
correct_answer: 1
expected_output:
- 'error[E0038]: the trait `MyTrait` is not dyn compatible'
- because method `method` references the `Self` type in its return type
explanation: |-
  This question tests understanding of dyn compatibility (formerly called object
  safety) in Rust, which determines whether a trait can be used as a trait object
  (with `dyn`).

  A trait is dyn compatible only if it meets certain criteria. One key requirement
  is that methods cannot return `Self` (except in specific cases like `Sized`
  bounds). When a method returns `Self`, the compiler cannot know at compile time
  what concrete type will be returned through a trait object, since trait objects
  erase the specific type information.

  In this code, the `method` function in `MyTrait` returns `Self`, which violates
  dyn compatibility rules. When attempting to create a trait object `&dyn
  MyTrait`, the compiler rejects this because it cannot guarantee type safety for
  methods that return `Self`.

  The error occurs because trait objects use dynamic dispatch and type erasure.
  The actual concrete type behind a trait object is not known at compile time,
  only at runtime. If a method could return `Self` through a trait object, the
  compiler wouldn't know what size to allocate or how to handle the returned
  value, since `Self` could be any type implementing the trait.

  The key takeaway is that dyn compatibility is a set of restrictions that ensure
  trait objects can work correctly with dynamic dispatch. Methods that return
  `Self`, use `Self` in certain positions, or have generic type parameters
  generally make a trait not dyn compatible.
